= Quarkus Pact Provider

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

https://pact.io/[Pact] is a polyglot contract testing framework.
This extension ensures Pact provider libraries works well with Quarkus applications, including with continuous testing.
It is based on version {pact-version} of the Pact JVM JUnit 5 library.

== Installation

To use this extension, add the `io.quarkiverse:quarkus-pact-provider` extension first to your build file.
Choose a 1.x version for Quarkus 3, and a 0.x version for Quarkus 2.

== Example usage

Use Pact as you https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/jvm/provider/junit5[normally would].
For example, a simple provider test for REST endpoints would look like this:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}/provider/SimpleContractTest.java[tag=include]
----

<1> Add `@Provider` annotations to the class, along with instructions where to find the pacts (a folder or a broker).
<2> We inject Quarkus configuration.
<3> With the injected configuration, we can tell the Pact verifier where to look for our endpoints.
<4> Standard Pact provider boilerplate, to create a series of templated tests which run the Pact verifications.

== Extension Configuration Reference

For the moment, Pact needs to be configured by the normal https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/jvm/docs/system-properties[Pact system properties].

== Known limitations

- `@State` methods do not not have access to the CDI context (https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-pact/issues/2[GitHub issue])
- When changing the code of classes with a `@TestTemplate`, continuous testing may not automatically retrigger (https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/33047[Fix PR])
