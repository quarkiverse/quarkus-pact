# Running the integration test project

Most problems are complex classloading ones, which are only exposed by running the integration tests.

Running the integration test application without running the tests can sometimes be useful for debugging.
See [the test project `README.md`](integration-tests/src/test/resources-filtered/projects/happy-knitter/README.md) for
instructions.
